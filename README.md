# Real-time Orderbook Simulator 
This Python application simulates a real-time order book, providing a visual representation of buy and sell orders in a financial market. It offers a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to observe the order book in action, with randomised buy and sell orders being generated and displayed.

The application generates random buy and sell orders for BTC/GBP and displays them within a graphical user interface (GUI).
